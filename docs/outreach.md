## Short Intro (Email / DM)

Hi,

I'm working on PIXN — a Pre-MVP execution-layer concept for AI-related tasks.
The focus is on defining a clean execution boundary before introducing agent intelligence.

We already have:
- a runnable API demo
- a documented architecture
- a clear Pre-MVP scope

GitHub: https://github.com/pixcoinai/pixn

Happy to share more context if this aligns with your interests.

Best regards,
PIXN Team

## One-Sentence Pitch

PIXN validates the execution layer for AI agents before adding intelligence or decentralization.
