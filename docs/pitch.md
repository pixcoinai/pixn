# PIXN Network — Pre-MVP Pitch

## One-liner
PIXN is an execution-layer concept for AI-related tasks, focused on clean separation between task submission and future agent execution.

---

## Problem
AI and Web3 developers experimenting with agents lack:
- a simple execution boundary
- a verifiable task submission surface
- infrastructure that does not overpromise intelligence too early

Most projects start with models instead of execution.

---

## Solution
PIXN provides:
- a minimal API for task submission
- a clear execution boundary
- a runnable demo proving feasibility
- an architecture designed for extension, not hype

---

## Current Stage
**Pre-MVP / concept with runnable demo**

What exists:
- HTTP API
- enforced execution boundary
- local demo execution
- CI pipeline

What does not exist:
- agent logic
- AI models
- decentralization

This is intentional.

---

## Why This Matters
Execution layers are hard to retrofit later.
PIXN validates the foundation first.

---

## What Comes Next
- agent execution interface
- in-memory task lifecycle
- execution contracts

No timelines are promised.
