# Project Stage

PIXN is currently in a **Pre-MVP stage** with a runnable technical demo.

This repository demonstrates a conceptually complete execution boundary,
but does not yet implement full task processing or agent intelligence.

---

## What Exists Today

- Runnable HTTP API
- Task submission endpoint (/task)
- Enforced request constraints (POST-only)
- Documented execution boundary
- Verified local demo execution
- Continuous Integration pipeline

---

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- Agent execution logic
- Task lifecycle management
- Persistence or state storage
- AI model integration
- Distributed or decentralized components

---

## Why This Stage Matters

The goal of this stage is to:
- Validate architectural assumptions
- Demonstrate a working execution surface
- Avoid premature complexity
- Provide a concrete foundation for future development

---

## Next Logical Milestones

- Define agent execution interface
- Introduce basic in-memory task handling
- Formalize execution contracts
- Evaluate execution backends

No delivery timelines are committed at this stage.
