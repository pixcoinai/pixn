# Token Considerations (Future)

PIXN does not introduce a token at the current Pre-MVP stage.

A token model may be explored in the future only if:
- execution becomes distributed
- independent executors require incentives
- on-chain accounting is introduced

No token design, supply, or utility decisions are made at this stage.
