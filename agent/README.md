# Agent Module (Planned)

This directory defines the boundary for the PIXN agent layer.

No executable agent logic is implemented at this stage.

---

## Purpose

The agent layer is intended to define how tasks are interpreted and executed,
while remaining decoupled from the API and transport layer.

---

## Current Status

- No agent implementation
- No AI model
- No autonomous behavior

This is intentional.

---

## Future Scope (Non-binding)

- Agent execution interfaces
- Task lifecycle hooks
- Validation and policy layers

No timelines are committed.

---

Execution precedes intelligence.
